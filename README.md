# rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple implementation of the grade-school classic “Rock Paper Scissors”.

A game of Rock Paper Scissors will be played in the console of the web page where the page
will prompt the user to enter a move against the computer for each round of the game.

The game will last 5 rounds. The winner of the game will be determined by the best-of-5.

The game will be programmed in an HTML file with the JavaScript logic embedded in a script tag.
